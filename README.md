# Monty-Hall-Paradox-Proof
The Monty Hall Paradox is as follows: suppose you are a player in a game show and you are given an option to choose one of 3 doors, behind 2 of which are nothing and behind one is a prize. After randomly picking a door, the host of the gameshow opens one door that he knows has nothing behind, then the host gives you an option to switch to the other door or keep yours. What do you do? Most would think that it makes no difference, but in reality, switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning.
This code was made in my free time in the summer of 2019 to help me understand the math behind this problem.
